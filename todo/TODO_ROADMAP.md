## 🛠️ Technical Considerations

### Infrastructure Requirements

- **Email**: Integrate with existing business email system
- **CRM**: Connect with Go High Level as mentioned in ecosystem docs

### Development Environment
- **Staging Environment**: Set up staging branch for testing new features
- **Version Control**: Maintain clear branching strategy (main → staging → feature branches)
- **Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md files updated with each major change
- **Code Quality**: Maintain TypeScript strict mode and ESLint compliance

### Security Considerations
- **HTTPS**: Ensure SSL certificate for all environments
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all form inputs and user data
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting for contact forms
- **Privacy**: GDPR/CCPA compliance for data collection

## 📞 Support & Resources

### When Adding New Features:
1. **Check existing documentation** in CLAUDE.md files
2. **Follow established patterns** for components and styling
3. **Test thoroughly** on multiple devices and browsers
4. **Update documentation** with any architectural changes
5. **Maintain TypeScript compliance** with proper interfaces
6. **Update Cloudinary assets** constants file when adding new images
7. **Test build process** before committing changes

### For Technical Issues:
1. **Check build status** with `npm run build`
2. **Verify dependency compatibility** with `npm audit`
3. **Test across browsers** and device sizes
4. **Review console errors** in browser dev tools
5. **Consult session documentation** for similar past issues

**Overall Assessment**: The site has excellent technical foundation with sophisticated tools (ROI Calculator, AI Assessment) and comprehensive Cloudinary integration. Critical gaps are in content population and form backend integration rather than fundamental architecture.

**Estimated completion for production launch**: 2-3 weeks with focused effort on content integration and missing assets.
