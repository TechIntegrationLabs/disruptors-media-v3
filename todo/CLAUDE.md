**Animation Categories**:
- **GSAP Timeline Animations**: Complex multi-element sequences
- **Framer Motion Transitions**: Component-level animations
- **Custom Interactions**: Scroll-triggered and user-interaction animations
- **Performance Optimization**: Animation performance best practices

**Implementation Patterns**:
```typescript
// GSAP Timeline Example
const tl = gsap.timeline();
tl.from('.hero-title', { opacity: 0, y: 50, duration: 1 })
  .from('.hero-subtitle', { opacity: 0, y: 30, duration: 0.8 }, '-=0.5')
  .from('.hero-cta', { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8, duration: 0.6 }, '-=0.3');

// Framer Motion Component Animation
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.6, ease: "easeOut" }}
>
```

**Usage**: Reference for implementing consistent, performant animations across the application

### Technical Architecture (`TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive system architecture documentation

**Architecture Overview**:
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript, component-based architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: React hooks with context for global state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM with nested service pages
- **Asset Management**: Cloudinary integration with local fallbacks
- **Build System**: Create React App with optimizations

**Integration Points**:
```
External Services:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cloudinary          # Asset management and optimization

## Task Management Workflows

### Sprint Planning Process

1. **Status Review**: Assess current completion metrics
2. **Priority Assignment**: Use roadmap to assign sprint priorities
3. **Resource Allocation**: Assign tasks based on technical requirements
4. **Timeline Estimation**: Reference roadmap timeline for realistic estimates

### Progress Tracking

**Weekly Status Updates**:
- Update completion percentages in README.md
- Move completed tasks from TODO_ROADMAP.md to done status
- Update CURRENT_STATUS_ASSESSMENT.md with new findings
- Document any architecture changes in TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md

**Milestone Tracking**:
```
Phase Completion Metrics:
- Phase 0 (Foundation): 95% ‚úÖ
- Phase 1 (Content): 40% ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- Phase 2 (Backend): 30% ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Phase 3 (Advanced): 0% ‚ùå
```

### Quality Assurance Process

**Pre-Launch Checklist**:
- [ ] All critical tasks completed (logos, forms, content)
- [ ] Performance testing completed (Lighthouse audit)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] SEO implementation validated
- [ ] Analytics tracking verified

## Development Commands for Task Management

```bash
# Project status checking
npm run status              # Generate current project status
npm run health:check        # Technical health assessment
npm run content:audit       # Content completion audit

# Progress tracking
npm run progress:update     # Update completion metrics
npm run roadmap:sync        # Sync completed tasks from roadmap
npm run milestone:report    # Generate milestone progress report
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Daily Standup Integration

**Status Check Pattern**:
1. Review README.md for overall status
2. Check TODO_ROADMAP.md for current sprint tasks
3. Update CURRENT_STATUS_ASSESSMENT.md with blockers
4. Plan day's work based on priority levels

### Feature Development Integration

**Task Completion Workflow**:
1. **Start Task**: Move from TODO_ROADMAP.md to in-progress
2. **Development**: Follow technical architecture guidelines
3. **Testing**: Validate against quality standards
4. **Completion**: Update status in all relevant documents
5. **Documentation**: Update technical summaries if architecture changes

### Release Planning

**Launch Readiness Assessment**:
- Cross-reference README.md completion metrics
- Validate all critical tasks completed in TODO_ROADMAP.md
- Confirm technical architecture supports production load
- Verify all animations and interactions perform optimally

## Stakeholder Communication

### Status Reporting

**For Executives**: README.md provides high-level completion metrics
**For Technical Teams**: TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md for implementation details  
**For Project Managers**: TODO_ROADMAP.md for timeline and priority planning
**For QA Teams**: CURRENT_STATUS_ASSESSMENT.md for testing focus areas

### Risk Management

**Risk Identification**:
- Critical task dependencies tracked in roadmap
- Technical architecture risks documented
- Resource allocation challenges identified
- Timeline risks highlighted with priority levels

This project management system provides comprehensive visibility into project status, clear development priorities, and structured workflows for efficient progression from current 70% completion to production-ready launch.
