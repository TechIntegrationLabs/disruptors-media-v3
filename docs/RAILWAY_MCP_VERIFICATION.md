"What's the current status of Railway?"

# Test project listing
"List all my Railway projects"
```

**Expected Responses**:
- ‚úÖ Railway MCP server responds without errors
- ‚úÖ Returns Railway platform status
- ‚úÖ Lists accessible projects

### 2. Deployment Test

**Via Railway MCP**:
```text
# Test deployment command
"Deploy the current project to Railway"

# Check deployment status
"What's the status of the latest Railway deployment?"

# Monitor deployment logs
"Show me the Railway deployment logs"
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Deployment initiates successfully
- ‚úÖ Status updates provided in real-time
- ‚úÖ Logs accessible through MCP interface

### 3. Environment Management Test

**Via Railway MCP**:
```text
# List environment variables
"Show me all Railway environment variables"

# Add a test variable
"Set TEST_VAR to 'mcp-working' on Railway"

# Verify variable was set
"List Railway environment variables again"
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables listed correctly
- ‚úÖ New variables can be set via MCP
- ‚úÖ Changes reflected in Railway dashboard

## üéõÔ∏è Admin Panel Integration Verification

5. Check Railway MCP status appears in feature matrix

**Expected Display**:
```
Platform: Local Development
Railway MCP: ‚úÖ Available
WebSocket Bridge: ‚úÖ Connected
MCP Servers: ‚úÖ 20+ servers including Railway
```

### 2. Railway Feature Detection Test

**Production Simulation**:
1. Set environment variable: `REACT_APP_RAILWAY=true`
2. Restart development server
3. Check admin panel shows "Railway" platform
4. Verify Railway-specific features are enabled

**Expected Behavior**:
- Platform detection shows "Railway"
- Railway MCP features enabled
- Claude CLI features disabled (production mode)
- WebSocket bridge configured for Railway domain

### 3. MCP Integration Test

**Admin Panel MCP Status**:
1. Navigate to AI Assistant tab
2. Check MCP server status grid
3. Verify Railway server shows as connected
4. Test Railway commands through chat interface

**Expected Display**:
```
MCP Server Status:
